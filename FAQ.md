# Frequently Asked Questions

# What is Sami ?

Sami is a decentralized communication application.

Said otherwise, it is an instant messaging app, like *Whatsapp*,
except communications do not rely on centralized servers
(like *Facebook's* in the case of *Whatsapp*),
and therefore have some advantages over its centralized counterpart !

See section [What is decentralization and why use it?](#what-is-decentralization-and-why-use-it-)

## Why should I use Sami ?

## What is decentralization and why use it ?

*Decentralization* is a way of interconnecting users,
as much as *centralization* is, though the two are often opposed.

### A centralized model: client-server

A common centralization model on the Internet is the client-server model.

In this scenario, all clients - your computer and those of your friends -
are connected to a single server.
If Alice wants to send a message to Bob, Alice sends her message to the server,
which relays it to Bob, and vice-versa.
From a technical point of view, this is pretty handy and allows for great control,
which is part of the reason it is so common.

### A decentralized model: peer-to-peer

Peer-to-peer on the other hand interconnects all users.
If Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she sends it directly to his computer !

While it looks straightforward, in practice it is harder to implement than a client-server model.
It's counterintuitive, yes, but like most things, there are historical reasons explaining this.
Mainly - though indirectly - Capitalism, I believe ;)
